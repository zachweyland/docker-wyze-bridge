## WebRTC/RTSP/RTMP/HLS Bridge for Wyze Cam

![479shots_so](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67088095/224595527-05242f98-c4ab-4295-b9f5-07051ced1008.png)

Create a local WebRTC, RTSP, RTMP, or HLS/Low-Latency HLS stream for most of your Wyze cameras including the outdoor, doorbell, and 2K cams.

No modifications, third-party, or special firmware required.

It just works!

Streams direct from camera without additional bandwidth or subscriptions.

## Quick Start

Install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and run:

```bash
docker run -p 8554:8554 -p 8888:8888 -p 5050:5000 -e WB_AUTH=false ghcr.io/zachweyland/docker-wyze-bridge:latest
```

You can then use the web interface at `http://localhost:5050` where `localhost` is the hostname or ip of the machine running the bridge.

This fork's GitHub Actions workflow is configured to publish to `ghcr.io/zachweyland/docker-wyze-bridge` by default. Docker Hub publishing is optional.

See [basic usage](#basic-usage) for additional information or visit the [wiki page](https://github.com/idisposable/docker-wyze-bridge/wiki/Home-Assistant) for additional information on using the bridge as a Home Assistant Add-on.

## What's Changed in v4.0.2

Stability hardening for the KVS/WebRTC -> WHEP -> MediaMTX path.

- Fixed `/websocket/{streamID}` to reject non-`POST` methods with `405`
- Rewrote downstream RTP sequence numbers per local track to keep output monotonic (including SPS/PPS replay cases)
- Added timeout protection to KVS config refresh requests
- Closed websocket handshake response bodies on dial-error paths
- Relaxed WHEP content-type checks to accept `application/sdp; charset=...`

The v4.0.1 notes are preserved below.

## What's Changed in v4.0.1

This fork adds a KVS/WebRTC -> WHEP -> MediaMTX path for Wyze KVS cameras, including the Wyze Cam Floodlight Pro (`LD_CFP`), so they can be exposed as stable local RTSP streams.

- Added a standalone WHEP proxy in [`whep_proxy/`](./whep_proxy) to bridge Wyze KVS WebRTC sessions into MediaMTX
- Added upstream readiness checks so MediaMTX does not start a KVS-backed path until video is actually available
- Added SPS/PPS replay before every IDR to make H264 decode recovery more reliable for RTSP consumers
- Added KVS wake deduplication and better startup retry behavior so a single missed KVS handshake does not permanently remove the stream path
- Fixed the MediaMTX audio track metadata to advertise Wyze `PCMU` audio honestly as stereo (`PCMU/8000/2`) so downstream transcoders can downmix it correctly

For KVS cameras, the bridge now exposes the normal RTSP path once the upstream WebRTC session is warm:

```text
rtsp://<bridge-ip>:8554/<camera-uri>
```

Example:

```text
rtsp://192.168.6.10:8554/backyard-cam
```

Recommended environment for KVS/WHEP cameras:

- `ON_DEMAND=False`
- `WHEP_SIGNALING_DELAY_MS=1000`

If consuming the stream through Scrypted, setting the FFmpeg Input Arguments Prefix below is recommended to improve startup and sync-frame detection on lossy streams:

```text
-fflags +genpts+discardcorrupt -analyzeduration 15000000 -probesize 5000000
```

The older v4.0.0 notes from the upstream redux branch are preserved below.

### Upstream redux notes

- Added validation checks for the API Key ID and API Key to help prevent issues logging in Fixes #47
- Cleaned up the thread and process tracking to ensure that we release threads when they're done
- Only allow one running purge thread per camera Fixes #40
- Added timeouts to all the thread `.join()`s to ensure we don't hang waiting for threads to die off
- Increased the buffer size for the pipe reads to reduce CPU load
- Consistently swallow ValueError, AttributeError, RuntimeError, and FileNotFound errors so sub-processes and threads terminate correctly

Note: v3.12.2 was everything above, but missing the change notes, oops.

## What's Changed in v3.12.1

Cleaned MQTT logic and pull in some others' changes

### New features

Automatic Sunrise/Sunset snapshots drive ny the `LONGITUDE` and `LATITUDE` configuration variables.
`FORCE_IOTC_DETAIL` if true will force detailed debugging for the IOTC subsystem which can be used to decode a camera's protocol messages.

- Read the TUTK device_config.json once not every interaction
- Gathering up other changes
  - Add GW_DBD Doorbell Duo to list not yet validated from @Angel-Vazquez change

)
  - Picking up the relevant changes from p2pcam
- Cleanup of config circular dependencies
- Fix run if syntax old habits die hard

## What's Changed in v3.12.0

Cleaned up the startup logic to ensure things start quickly and moved configurations around so everything is overrideable

- Clean up the /var/log directory in Dockerfile build image
- Better to supply empty, not samples in config
- Switch to `run` for diagnostic dump
- Deprecate the `config.yml` setting of environment variables so we can set the `IMG_DIR` and `RECORD_PATH` reliably even
  if not running inside Home Assistant as an add-on
- Remove the MTX_* variables from the `.env` as we want them to be settable in the options.
- Explicitly default the MTX settings that used to be forced (MTX_READTIMEOUT=30s, MTX_HLSVARIANT=mpegts, MTX_WRITEQUEUESIZE=2048) 
  to ensure backward compatibility
- Updated the defaults for the `IMG_DIR` and `RECORD_PATH` to match what the `.env` would have 
  previously set, but now it's overridable.
- Reduced log spam by making some `.info(` calls `.debug(`
- Don't emit ffmpeg non-error messages  (let the Popen eat them).

## What's Changed in v3.11.1

Turns out you cannot have a completely optional section in a config.yml

Use something like

```yaml
CAM_OPTIONS:

## What's Changed in v3.10.3

- Bump MediaMTX to 1.12.1

## What's Changed in v3.10.2

- Added code to protect against the aggressive syntax check in MediaMTX 1.12.0 which
  complains about the `recordPath` missing required elements even when recording is
  not enabled (it really shouldn't validate that setting unless one or more paths
  request recording...and didn't through 1.11.3).
  For reference, the pattern is computed from our `RECORD_PATH` and `RECORD_FILE_NAME`
  settings and the combination of them must contain the `strftime` format specifiers
  of *either* a `"%s"` or **all** of of "%Y", "%m", "%d", "%H", "%M", "%S" (case-sensitive).
  If the value is not compliant, to keep MediaMTX from erroring out, we append `"_%s"` whatever
  was specified and emit a warning.
- Changed the default `RECORD_PATH` to ~`"record/%path/%Y/%m/%d/"`~ *v3.10.7* `"%path/{cam_name}/%Y/%m/%d"`
- Changed the default `RECORD_FILE_NAME` to `"%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M-%S"`

## What's Changed in v3.10.1

- Add `TOTP_KEY` and `MQTT_DTOPIC` to *config.yml* schema to avoid logged warning noise
- Add `MQTT_DTOPIC` to *config.yml* options to ensure a usable default
- Add `video: true` to all the *config.yml* variants to ensure hardware encoding can
  use video card
- Upgrade to `python:3.13-slim-bookworm` for docker base image
- Cleaned up Dockerfile scripts for testing and multiarch
- Safer docker build by testing the tarballs downloaded for MediaMTX or FFMpeg

## What's Changed in v3.10.0

- Attempt upgrade of MediaMTX to 1.12.0 (again)
- Fixed schema of RECORD_LENGTH config option (it needs an `s` or `h` suffix, so must be string)
- Added RECORD_KEEP to the config.yml so it can be actually be configured in the add-on

## What's Changed in v3.0.7

- Better logging of exceptions and pass the MediaMTX messages through to main logs
- Correct building of permissions for MediaMTX
- Documented all the possible points in the docker-compose files.

## What's Changed in v3.0.6

- Revert MediaMTX to 1.11.3 because 1.12 doesn't work here.

## What's Changed in v3.0.5 ~DELETED~

- Fix MediaMTX to pass a user name [since 1.12.0 now requires one](https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/compare/v1.11.3...v1.12.0#diff-b5c575fc54691bae05c5cc598fac91c97876b3d15687c359f970a8b832ab3ab6R23-R41)

## What's Changed in v3.0.4  ~DELETED~

- Chore: Bump [MediaMTX to 1.12.0](https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/releases/tag/v1.12.0)

## What's Changed in v3.0.3

Rehoming this to ensure it lives on since PR merges have stalled in the original (and most excellent) @mrlt8 repo, I am surfacing a new
release with the PRs I know work. **Note** The badges on the GitHub repo may be broken and the donation links *still* go to @mrlt8 (as they should!)

- Chore: Bump Flask to 3.1.*
- Chore: Bump Pydantic to 2.11.*
- Chore: Bump Python-dotenv to 1.1.*
- Chore: Bump MediaMTX to 1.11.3
- FIX: Add host_network: true for use in Home Assistant by @jdeath to allow communications in Docker

- Chore: Adjust everything for move to my GitHub repo and Docker Hub account

## What's Changed in v2.10.3

- FIX: Increased `MTX_WRITEQUEUESIZE` to prevent issues with higher bitrates.
- FIX: Restart RTMP livestream on fail (#1333)
- FIX: Restore user data on bridge restart (#1334)
- NEW: `SNAPSHOT_KEEP` Option to delete old snapshots when saving snapshots with a timelapse-like custom format with `SNAPSHOT_FORMAT`. (#1330)
  - Example for 3 min: `SNAPSHOT_KEEP=180`, `SNAPSHOT_KEEP=180s`, `SNAPSHOT_KEEP=3m`

  - Example for 3 weeks: `SNAPSHOT_KEEP=21d`, `SNAPSHOT_KEEP=3w`
- NEW: `RESTREAMIO` option for livestreaming via [restream.io](https://restream.io). (#1333)
  - Example `RESTREAMIO_FRONT_DOOR=re_My_Custom_Key123`

## What's Changed in v2.10.2

- FIX: day/night FPS slowdown for V4 cameras (#1287) Thanks @cdoolin and @Answer-1!
- NEW: Update battery level in WebUI

## What's Changed in v2.10.0/v2.10.1

FIXED: Could not disable `WB_AUTH` if `WB_API` is set. (#1304)

### WebUI Authentication

Simplify default credentials for the WebUI:

- This will not affect users who are setting their own `WB_PASSWORD` and `WB_API`.
- Default `WB_PASSWORD` will now be derived from the username part of the Wyze email address instead of using a randomly generated password.
  - Example: For the email address `john123@doe.com`, the `WB_PASSWORD` will be `john123`.
- Default `WB_API` will be based on the wyze account for persistance.

### Stream Authentication

NEW: `STREAM_AUTH` option to specify multiple users and paths:

- Username and password should be separated by a `:`
- An additional `:` can be used to specify the allowed IP address for the user.
  - **This does NOT work with docker desktop**
  - Specify multiple IPs using a comma
- Use the `@` to specify paths accessible to the user.
  - Paths are optional for each user.  
  - Multiple paths can be specified by using a comma. If none are provided, the user will have access to all paths/streams
- Multiple users can be specified by using  `|` as a separator

  **EXAMPLE**:

```yaml
  STREAM_AUTH=user:pass@cam-1,other-cam|second-user:password@just-one-cam|user3:pass
```

- `user:pass`  has access to `cam-1` and `other-cam`
- `second-user:password` has access to `just-one-cam`
- `user3:pass` has access to **all** paths/cameras

  See [Wiki](https://github.com/mrlt8/docker-wyze-bridge/wiki/Authentication#custom-stream-auth) for more information and examples.

### Recording via MediaMTX

Recoding streams has been updated to use MediaMTX with the option to delete older clips.

Use `RECORD_ALL` or `RECORD_CAM_NAME` to enable recording.

- `RECORD_FILE_NAME` Available variables are `%path`, `{CAM_NAME}`, `{cam_name}`, `%Y` `%m` `%d` `%H` `%M` `%S` `%f` `%s` (time in strftime format).
- `RECORD_PATH` Available variables are `%path`, `{CAM_NAME}`, `{cam_name}`, `%Y` `%m` `%d` `%H` `%M` `%S` `%f` `%s` (time in strftime format).
- `RECORD_LENGTH` Length of each clip. Use `s` for seconds , `h` for hours. Defaults to `60s`
- `RECORD_KEEP` Delete older clips. Use `s` for seconds , `h` for hours. Set to 0s to disable automatic deletion. Defaults to `0s`

Note that as of release v3.10.0, which uses *mediaMTX 1.12.0*, requires the combination of your `RECORD_FILE_NAME` and `RECORD_PATH` settings
specifying recording's file complete path **MUST** reference **ALL** of `%Y` `%m` `%d` `%H` `%M` `%S` tokens, for example:
`RECORD_FILE_NAME = "%H%M%S%"` and `RECORD_PATH_NAME = "{path}/{cam_name}/%Y/%m/%d%"` would be valid. You can also just
ensure the combined path includes `%s` (which is the unix epoch value as an integer).

## FAQ

- How does this work?
  - It uses the same SDK as the app to communicate directly with the cameras. See [kroo/wyzecam](https://github.com/kroo/wyzecam) for details.
- Does it use internet bandwidth when streaming?
  - Not in most cases. The bridge will attempt to stream locally if possible but will fallback to streaming over the internet if you're trying to stream from a different location or from a shared camera. See the [wiki](https://github.com/mrlt8/docker-wyze-bridge/wiki/Network-Connection-Modes) for more details.
- Can this work offline/can I block all wyze services?
  - No. Streaming should continue to work without an active internet connection, but will probably stop working after some time as the cameras were not designed to be used without the cloud. Some camera commands also depend on the cloud and may not function without an active connection. See [wz_mini_hacks](https://github.com/gtxaspec/wz_mini_hacks/wiki/Configuration-File#self-hosted--isolated-mode) for firmware level modification to run the camera offline.
- Why aren't all wyze cams supported yet (OG/Doorbell Pro)?
  - These cameras are using a different SDK and will require a different method to connect and stream. See the awesome [cryze](https://github.com/carTloyal123/cryze) project by @carTloyal123.

## Basic Usage

### docker-compose (recommended)

This is similar to the docker run command, but will save all your options in a yaml file.

1. Install [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
2. Use the [sample](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/idisposable/docker-wyze-bridge/main/docker-compose.sample.yml) as a guide to create a `docker-compose.yml` file with your wyze credentials.
3. Run `docker-compose up`.

Once you're happy with your config you can use `docker-compose up -d` to run it in detached mode.

> [!CAUTION]
> If your credentials contain a `$` character, you need to escape it with another `$` sign (e.g., `pa$$word` > `pa$$$$word`) or leave your credentials blank and use the webUI to login.
>
> [!NOTE]
> You may need to [update the WebUI links](https://github.com/mrlt8/docker-wyze-bridge/wiki/WebUI#custom-ports) if you're changing the ports or using a reverse proxy.

#### Updating your container

To update your container, `cd` into the directory where your `docker-compose.yml` is located and run:

```bash
docker-compose pull # Pull new image
docker-compose up -d # Restart container in detached mode
docker image prune # Remove old images
```

## Web-UI

The bridge features a basic Web-UI which can display a preview of all your cameras as well as direct links to all the video streams.

The web-ui can be accessed on the default port `5000`:

```http
http://localhost:5000/
```

## WebRTC

WebRTC should work automatically in Home Assistant mode, however, some additional configuration is required to get WebRTC working in the standard docker mode.

- WebRTC requires two additional ports to be configured in docker:

```yaml
ports:
  - 8889:8889 #WebRTC
  - 8189:8189/udp # WebRTC/ICE
```

- In addition, the `WB_IP` env needs to be set with the IP address of the server running the bridge.

```yaml
environment:
  - WB_IP=192.168.1.116
```

- See [documentation](https://github.com/aler9/rtsp-simple-server#usage-inside-a-container-or-behind-a-nat) for additional information/options.
