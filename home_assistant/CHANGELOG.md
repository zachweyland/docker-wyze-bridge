# What's Changed

## What's Changed in v4.0.2

Stability and signaling hardening for the KVS -> WHEP proxy path.

- Fixed `/websocket/{streamID}` to reject non-`POST` methods with `405` instead of risking nil config use.
- Rewrote downstream RTP sequence numbers per local track so replayed SPS/PPS and live packets stay monotonic.
- Added an HTTP timeout for KVS config refresh requests to avoid hanging reconnect loops.
- Closed websocket handshake response bodies in error paths to prevent leaks.
- Relaxed WHEP SDP content-type handling to accept `application/sdp; charset=...`.

## What's Changed in v4.0.1

Cleaned up the threading logic around startup/shutdown to reduce CPU and memory leaks

- Added validation checks for the API Key ID and API Key to help prevent issues logging in Fixes #47
- Cleaned up the thread and process tracking to ensure that we release threads when they're done
- Only allow one running purge thread per camera Fixes #40
- Added timeouts to all the thread `.join()`s to ensure we don't hang waiting for threads to die off
- Increased the buffer size for the pipe reads to reduce CPU load
- Consistently swallow ValueError, AttributeError, RuntimeError, and FileNotFound errors so sub-processes and threads terminate correctly
- Fixed the MediaMTX audio track metadata to advertise Wyze `PCMU` audio honestly as stereo (`PCMU/8000/2`)

Note: v3.12.2 was everything above, but missing the change notes, oops.

# What's Changed in v3.12.1

Cleaned MQTT logic and pull in some others' changes

### New features

Automatic Sunrise/Sunset snapshots drive ny the `LONGITUDE` and `LATITUDE` configuration variables.
`FORCE_IOTC_DETAIL` if true will force detailed debugging for the IOTC subsystem which can be used to decode a camera's protocol messages.

- MQTT cleanup with more logging and move configuration to config.py
- Read the TUTK device_config.json once not every interaction
- Gathering up other changes
  - Add GW_DBD Doorbell Duo to list not yet validated from @Angel-Vazquez change
  - Add SNAPSHOT_CAMERAS and  sunset/sunrise snapshots from @ruddell [see](https://github.com/mrlt8/docker-wyze-bridge/compare/main...ruddell:docker-wyze-bridge:sunrise-snapshotter
)
  - Picking up the relevant changes from p2pcam
- Cleanup of config circular dependencies
- Fix run if syntax old habits die hard

# What's Changed in v3.12.0

Cleaned up the startup logic to ensure things start quickly and moved configurations around so everything is overrideable

- Moved API-driven snapshots into the `Stream_Manager.py` so they don't delay startup.
- Clean up the /var/log directory in Dockerfile build image
- Better to supply empty, not samples in config
- Switch to `run` for diagnostic dump
- Deprecate the `config.yml` setting of environment variables so we can set the `IMG_DIR` and `RECORD_PATH` reliably even
  if not running inside Home Assistant as an add-on
- Remove the MTX_* variables from the `.env` as we want them to be settable in the options.
- Explicitly default the MTX settings that used to be forced (MTX_READTIMEOUT=30s, MTX_HLSVARIANT=mpegts, MTX_WRITEQUEUESIZE=2048) 
  to ensure backward compatibility
- Updated the defaults for the `IMG_DIR` and `RECORD_PATH` to match what the `.env` would have 
  previously set, but now it's overridable.
- Reduced log spam by making some `.info(` calls `.debug(`
- Don't emit ffmpeg non-error messages  (let the Popen eat them).

## What's Changed in v3.11.1

## What's Changed in v3.10.3

- Bump MediaMTX to 1.12.1

## What's Changed in v3.10.2

- Added code to protect against the aggressive syntax check in MediaMTX 1.12.0 which
  complains about the `recordPath` missing required elements even when recording is
  not enabled (it really shouldn't validate that setting unless one or more paths
  request recording...and didn't through 1.11.3).
  For reference, the pattern is computed from our `RECORD_PATH` and `RECORD_FILE_NAME`
  settings and the combination of them must contain the `strftime` format specifiers
  of *either* a `"%s"` or **all** of of "%Y", "%m", "%d", "%H", "%M", "%S" (case-sensitive).
  If the value is not compliant, to keep MediaMTX from erroring out, we append `"_%s"` whatever
  was specified and emit a warning.
- Changed the default `RECORD_PATH` to ~`"record/%path/%Y/%m/%d/"`~ *v3.10.7* `"%path/{cam_name}/%Y/%m/%d"`
- Changed the default `RECORD_FILE_NAME` to `"%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M-%S"`

## What's Changed in v3.10.1

- Add `TOTP_KEY` and `MQTT_DTOPIC` to *config.yml* schema to avoid logged warning noise
- Add `MQTT_DTOPIC` to *config.yml* options to ensure a usable default
- Add `video: true` to all the *config.yml* variants to ensure hardware encoding can
  use video card
- Upgrade to `python:3.13-slim-bookworm` for docker base image
- Cleaned up Dockerfile scripts for testing and multiarch
- Safer docker build by testing the tarballs downloaded for MediaMTX or FFMpeg

## What's Changed in v3.10.0

- Attempt upgrade of MediaMTX to 1.12.0 (again)
- Fixed schema of RECORD_LENGTH config option (it needs an `s` or `h` suffix, so must be string)
- Added RECORD_KEEP to the config.yml so it can be actually be configured in the add-on

## What's Changed in v3.0.7

- Better logging of exceptions and pass the MediaMTX messages through to main logs
- Correct building of permissions for MediaMTX
- Documented all the possible points in the docker-compose files.

## What's Changed in v3.0.6

- Revert MediaMTX to 1.11.3 because 1.12 doesn't work here.
